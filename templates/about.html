            <p>
                The CGS IBDP Gazette is a student-led digital magazine, a vibrant hub of
                journalism and creativity within the Costeas-Geitonas School's IB community.
                Born from a vision to amplify student voices, we strive to capture the
                essence of IB life, both within our school walls and in the broader global context.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since our inception, we have been dedicated to showcasing the remarkable
                projects, insightful research, and diverse achievements of CGS students.
                Our platform offers monthly insights into school events, discussions on
                pertinent global issues, and a spotlight on the unique experiences
                that shape our learners. We believe in the power of student journalism
                to connect, inform, and inspire.
